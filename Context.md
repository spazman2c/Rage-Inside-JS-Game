🎮 Project Name

UrbanPulse (placeholder — rename as desired)
🧠 Concept Overview

This is an open-world sandbox game built using JavaScript and Babylon.js. The game features a procedurally generated small city-like world with interactive elements inspired by Grand Theft Auto (GTA): vehicles, NPCs, dynamic missions, crime/chaos systems, and player progression. The initial version will be single-player, with multiplayer considered later.
🧱 Core Features
🌍 World

    Randomly generated map each session or stored seed for replayability

    Zoned areas: urban (shops, apartments), industrial, rural outskirts

    Road network with traffic logic

    Spawn points for missions, vehicles, and NPCs

🧍 Characters

    Player avatar with third-person camera and movement

    NPCs with behavior trees: civilians, police, gangsters

    Basic AI: pathfinding, state-based interaction (idle, flee, pursue, attack)

🚗 Vehicles

    Driveable cars, bikes, trucks

    Traffic system with NPC drivers

    Vehicle entry/exit mechanics

    Vehicle physics with collisions

🎯 Missions

    Simple dynamic missions: delivery, chase, theft, timed events

    Mission triggers tied to location or NPC interaction

    Optional mini-map UI with markers
